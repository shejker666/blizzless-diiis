# Installation

## Supported Clients

Each version of the client includes changes to structures, opcodes and attributes.

The currently supported version of the client: **2.7.4.84161**

## Server Deploying
### Prepare Database
#### Manual
1. Install [PostgreSQL 9.5.25](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
2. Create databases in PostgreSQL: `diiis` and `worlds`.
3. Change you account and password in `database.Account.config` and `database.Worlds.conifg`.
4. Restore `worlds.backup` to `worlds` database.

#### Or using docker
1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Run `docker-compose up` inside [db](db) folder.

### Compile and run
1. Install [.NET 7 SDK and runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) (just runtime, not asp.net or desktop)
2. Go to the repo directory and compile the project using this command:
```shell
dotnet publish ./src/DiIiS-NA/Blizzless.csproj --configuration Release --output ./publish
```
3. __Skip this stage for local game__ Copy the [config.mods.json](https://github.com/blizzless/blizzless-diiis/blob/community/configs/config.mods.json) file to the folder, and modify however you want. A file will be generated automatically from the `config.ini` for now.
4. Update your `config.ini` file on the published folder with your network's IP records (`BindIP` and `PublicIP`)
5. Go to the publish folder, launch Blizzless executable, wait until server start - it creates a hierarchy.
6. Create user account(s) using console: `!account add Login Password Tag`
 - Example:
  - `!account add username@ YourPassword YourBattleTag`
 - Creates an account with Login `username@`, password `YourPassword` and BattleTag `YourBattleTag`
  - `!account add username@ YourPassword YourBattleTag owner`
 - Creates an account with Login `username@`, password `YourPassword` and BattleTag `YourBattleTag` with rank `owner`

### Example:

> !account add username@ YourPassword YourBattleTag

Creates an account with Login `username@`, password `YourPassword` and BattleTag `YourBattleTag`

> !account add username@ YourPassword YourBattleTag owner

Creates an account with Login `username@`, password `YourPassword` and BattleTag `YourBattleTag` with rank `owner`

## Prepare Client

Do this for each client connecting to the server.

1. Get [supported client](#supported-clients) Diablo 3.

2. Install certificate [bnetserver.p12](src/DiIiS-NA/bnetserver.p12), password - `123` (the game verifies the CA root certificates).

3. Setting up redirects client to your server:

	**Method #1 - Hosts**

	  Add redirects to the `hosts` file (Windows - `%WinDir%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`, Linux - `/etc/hosts`):  
	  `127.0.0.1 us.actual.battle.net`  
	  `127.0.0.1 eu.actual.battle.net`

	  !After the modification the official Battle.Net application will not be able to connect to the server!

	  **Method #2 - Modify main executable file**

	  ```c
	  // Find null-terminated string enum and rewrite with HexEditor to your IP server.
	  eu.actual.battle.net/
	  us.actual.battle.net/
	  cn.actual.battle.net/
	  kr.actual.battle.net/
	  ```

4. Launch client (`x64` or `x86`) with arguments `"Diablo III64.exe" -launch`

5. Login to the game using your credentials.

6. [Skip this stage for local game] After that, when creating a game (in client), indicate the creation of a public game. Other players, when connecting, must also indicate a public game, and at the start they will connect to you.

7. You're in the game world!
