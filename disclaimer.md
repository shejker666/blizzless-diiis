## Legal Notice

This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. By using this software, you agree to do so at your own risk. The developers are not responsible for any damage to your game account, computer, or data that may result from its use. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use this software to connect to the official game servers.

## Educational Purpose
The primary goal of this project is for educational and research purposes only. It is intended as a learning tool for developers interested in studying network programming, game server architecture, and the principles of reverse engineering for interoperability. The project does not contain any proprietary or copyrighted code or assets from the original game. It is a clean-room implementation developed through independent research.

We do not aim to create a replacement for the official game service or to harm the commercial success of the original product. We encourage users to support the original developers by purchasing their games.

## Legal Requirement: You Must Own the Game
This software is intended to be used exclusively with a legally purchased copy of the game. You must own a valid license for Diablo III to use this software. We do not provide the game client, game assets, or any means to acquire them.

## Strict Anti-Piracy Policy
We have a zero-tolerance policy towards piracy. This project does not condone, support, or enable the illegal acquisition or use of copyrighted material.

Any discussion, request, or sharing of links related to illegal downloads of the game client or any copyrighted assets is strictly prohibited in all community channels associated with this project (such as Discord, forums, or GitHub issues) and will result in an immediate and permanent ban. Our focus is on the technical study of server implementation, not on circumventing legal ownership.
